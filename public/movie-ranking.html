<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO JAY</h1>
 <h2>MY TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME!</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>#1 SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE</h3>
 <p>The art style of this movie and the work they put into it is amazing!!!</p>
 <h3>#2 SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE</h3>
 <p>I love Spider-Man especially this one I relate to the character's story as Miles.</p>
 <h3>#3 SNATCH</h3>
 <p>This movie honestly could've easily been in the other 2 spots as well. The story<br/>
is good but it's how it's told that does it wonders. The different perspectives throughout<br/>
the story and wrapping them all together is chef's kiss, and I love Brad Pitt's Character.</p>
